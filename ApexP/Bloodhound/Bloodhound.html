        <p>Bloodhound is known across the Outlands as one of the greatest game hunters the Frontier has ever seen – and that’s about all anyone knows. Their identity is a mystery wrapped in layers of rumors: they are fabulously wealthy, a bloodthirsty murderer, a Goliath whisperer, a former slave, half bat, and a dozen other things depending on who’s doing the whispering.

        <p>The axe appears to be brand-new and has an eagle-like carving and red highlights. It appears a few times in the trailer, which shows Bloodhound taking a leap with the axe in their hand.</p><br>
