        <h1><b>Lifeline</b></h1>
        <span>Combat Medic</span><br>
        <p>Ajay Che, aka Lifeline, isn’t someone you would expect to find in the Apex Games. Once the child of wealthy war profiteers, she left home when she learned of the damage her family had caused and enlisted in the Frontier Corps, a humanitarian organization that aids Frontier communities in need. She’s since devoted her life to helping others and joined the Apex Games to fund the Frontier Corps with her winnings.

<br>Since no one in the Games is innocent — they all know what they signed up for — and every one of her victories means help for those in need, Lifeline has no problem engaging in the popular bloodsport. Or so she tells herself. She may seem sarcastic and callous, but deep down she wants to help people and make the world a better place. If that means taking a few people down in the process, so be it.

        <h2>Heirloom</h2>
        <p>Apex Legends' Lifeline is getting her heirloom--a special legendary item that provides a unique melee animation--next, making her the third Legend to do so. According to dataminers, her heirloom is a pair of taser drumsticks, which fits given her execution and banner animations</p><br>
