        <h1><b>Wraith</b></h1>
        <span>Void Walker</span><br>
        <p>Wraith is a whirlwind fighter, able to execute swift and deadly attacks and manipulate spacetime by opening rifts in the fabric of reality â€” but she has no idea how she got that way. Years ago, she woke up in an IMC Detention Facility for the Mentally Ill with no memory of her life before. She also began hearing a distant voice whispering in her mind that would keep her awake for days on end. Despite nearly driving her insane, once she started to listen and trust it, the voice helped her harness her newfound power of void manipulation and escape the facility.</p><br>

        <h2>Heirloom</h2>
        <p>The Melee Weapon Skin is called the Kunai. When you run around in-game while playing Wraith with your guns holstered it will show the knife. It doesn't do any extra damage compared to your regular melee strikes, but it does look pretty awesome.</p><br>
