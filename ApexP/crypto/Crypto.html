        <h1><b>Crypto</b></h1>
        <span>Survelliance Expert</span><br>
        <p>Crypto specializes in secrets; he knows how to uncover them, and how to keep them. A brilliant hacker and encryption expert, he uses aerial drones to spy on his opponents in the Apex Arena without being seen. It’s been noted that his drones have a similar design to those created by wanted murderer Tae Joon Park.<br>
Orphans raised on the streets of Suotamo, Tae Joon and his foster sister Mila Alexander escaped a life of squalor by becoming computer engineers, designing drones that transmit the Apex Games throughout the Outlands. But one day, Tae Joon disappeared with an important company secret, and his sister vanished under mysterious and violent circumstances. However, Crypto claims to have had no contact with Tae Joon, and the case remains unsolved.
