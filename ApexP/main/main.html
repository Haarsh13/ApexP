    <h1><b>Apex Legends</b></h1>
    <p>Apex Legends is a free-to-play battle royale game developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. It was released for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on February 4, 2019, without any prior announcement or marketing. The game is in its fourth season.<br>

In Apex Legends, up to 20 three-person squads land on an island before searching for weapons and supplies to attempt to defeat all other players in combat. Each player must keep moving to avoid being caught outside the play area. The final team alive wins the round. The game is set in the same science fiction universe as Respawn Entertainment's Titanfall and Titanfall 2.<br>

Work on the game began sometime around late 2016 and early 2017, though the project remained a secret right up until its launch. The game's release in 2019 came as a surprise, as until that point it had been assumed that Respawn Entertainment was working on a third instalment to the Titanfall franchise, the studio's previous major title.<br>

Apex Legends received positive reviews from critics, who praised its gameplay, progression system, and fusion of elements from various genres. Some considered it a worthy competitor to Fortnite Battle Royale, a similar game that had gained massive popularity in the previous year. Apex Legends surpassed over 25 million players by the end of its first week, and 50 million within its first month. According to EA, as of July 2019, the game had approximately 8 to 10 million players a week and by October 2019 it had approximately 70 million players world-wide.<br></p>

    
    <h2><b>Gameplay</b></h2>
    <p>Apex Legends is an online multiplayer battle royale game featuring squads of three players using pre-made characters (called "Legends"), similar to those of hero shooters. Alternate modes have been introduced allowing for single and for two-player squads since the game's release.<br>
Each match generally features twenty teams of three-player squads. Players can join friends in a squad or can be matched randomly with other players. Prior to the match, each player on the squad selects one of the 12 playable characters (as of Season 4), with the exception that no character may be selected more than once by a squad. Each character in the squad has a unique design, personality, and abilities that provide different playstyles to the team. All teams are then placed on an aircraft that passes over the game map. One player in each squad is the jumpmaster, selecting when the squad should skydive out of the aircraft and where to land with the concurrence of the other squad members. However, players are free to deviate from the squad's path.<br>

Once on the ground, the squad can scavenge for weapons, armor, and other equipment that is scattered around buildings, or in crates randomly distributed around the map, while keeping an eye out for other squads. Apex Legends includes a nonverbal communication "ping system" which allows players to use their game controller to communicate to their squad certain directions, weapon locations, enemies and suggested strategies.[5] While the game offers movement options similar to other shooters, it includes some of the gameplay features of previous Titanfall games, such as the ability to climb over short walls, slide down inclined surfaces, and use zip-lines to traverse an area quickly.<br>

Players who become knocked down in the course of a game can be revived by their squadmates. Should a player be killed completely, they can still be resurrected if their team member(s) collect their respawn banner, which appears at the place where they died, and bring it to one of several beacons on the island. The banner, however, must be collected within a time limit, before expiring and fully eliminating the player.<br></p>

<table border="1">
    <tr><th>Seasons</th><th colspan="2">Title</th><th colspan="4">Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td colspan="2">Wild Frontier</td><td colspan="4">The first season of Apex Legends introduced a new playable character known as Octane and included a number of bug fixes and quality of life improvements, including adjustments to so-called "hitboxes" (a predefined 'damageable' zone which is unique to each legend, based on their size and shape) and also unique skills of the game's characters. Season 1 also brought with it the game's first battle pass and a large number of new cosmetic items.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td colspan="2">Battle Charge</td><td colspan="4">With season 2, the developers introduced another playable character called Wattson and also re-designed the layout of the game's island. Following an explosion (shown in the season's trailer), roaming alien wildlife, known as leviathans and flyers, have been attracted to the island and destroyed large areas, rendering parts of the map unrecognisable from the previous season.[12] Season 2 also released a new weapon and introduced a new ranked mode of play, allowing players of a similar skill to play against each other, and adjusting a player's ranking based on their game performance.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td colspan="2">Meltdown</td><td colspan="4">A new legend named Crypto is introduced who has tried to rig the Apex games. A new weapon known as the Charge Rifle is added and changes to Ranked will be made. The season also comes with a brand new battle pass. A brand new map, named "World's Edge" is also introduced, which has players fighting through volcanic and frozen landscapes. The map also includes a train which travels throughout World's Edge. The season also changes up the meta by removing certain attachments and introducing new ones whilst changing what current items can do.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td colspan="2">Assimilation</td><td colspan="4">A new legend named Revenant is introduced, a Simulacrum with the memories of his human self. A new sniper weapon known as the Sentinel is added. World's Edge is devastated by a Harvester that has appeared in the middle of the map, creating lava faults and changing the environment. Changes to ranked were made, introducing a new tier known as "Master" tier, while Apex Predator tier is for the top 500 players on each platform, meaning players can be pushed out of it.</td> </tr>
